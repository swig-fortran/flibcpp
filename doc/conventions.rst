Conventions
************

Since the C++ and Fortran binding code are generated by SWIG-Fortran, most
conventions are based on its defaults and built-in wrappers as described in
`the SWIG+Fortran manual page`. This section attempts to describe all
conventions used by Flibcpp that may be ambiguous to either a C++ or Fortran
user.  Since Flibcpp's target audience is Fortran users, the library tries to
follows existing Fortran conventions, and this document attempts to remain true
to the official Fortran nomenclature as described in the ISO standards.

.. _the SWIG+Fortran manual page: https://github.com/swig-fortran/swig/blob/master/Doc/Manual/src/Fortran.md

Basic types
==============

The C++ standard library features many numeric classes and functions that take
a template parameter corresponding to the type of a single element used by the
class or algorithm. All such classes or functions that Flibcpp includes are
templated on:

  - 32-bit integers (``integer(4)`` or ``integer(C_INT32_T)``), with a suffix of
    ``Int4`` where applicable;
  - 64-bit integers (``integer(8)`` or ``integer(C_INT64_T)``), with a suffix of
    ``Int8`` where applicable; and
  - 64-bit reals (``real(8)`` or ``real(C_DOUBLE)``), with a suffix of
    ``Real8`` where applicable.

In general, most templated C++ functions use Fortran generic procedures to
allow a single procedure name to operate on multiple types, and only the
derived types (such as ``VectorInt4``) require the suffix.

Error handling
==============

Some modules support error handling for checking input values. In all cases,
the error status and a message can be accessed and cleared through the main
``flc`` module::

   use flc, only : ierr, get_serr

   ! <snip>
   if (ierr /= 0) then
     write(1,*) "Error", ierr, ":", get_serr()
     ! Reset the error flag to indicate that the error has been successfully
     ! handled.
     ierr = 0
   fi

Since errors do not immediately exit, it is up to the application code to check
for and clear them. Failing to clear the error code may cause the application
to exit on a subsequent Flibcpp procedure call.

.. _conventions_indexing:

Indexing
========

C and C++ use the convention that 0 corresponds to the first element in an
array: specifically, it indicates an *offset* of zero from the array's
beginning. In Fortran, the convention is for the first element to have an index
of 1, so Flibcpp has the same convention.

This convention makes native array integration straightforward. For example,
when the :ref:`modules_algorithm_binary_search` algorithm is used with any
value ``val`` in the sorted array ``arr``, the following logical expression
will be true::

   arr(binary_search(arr, val)) == val

An additional convention Flibcpp uses is for an invalid index to have a value
of zero. Thus, the :ref:`modules_algorithm_binary_search` algorithm returns
zero if asked to find an element that's not present.

Derived type behavior
=====================

The derived types defined by Flibcpp are all "proxy" objects that operate on
*pointers* to C++-owned objects. Some derived type values (i.e. class
instances) will "own" the associated data, while some will merely reference
data owned by other C++ objects.

.. note:: Memory management in SWIG-Fortran-generated code is unintuitive and
  could change. If you have feedback, please contact the author.

Construction
------------

Although Fortran separates the processes of allocation and initialization, C++
combines them into the single act of *construction*. Thus the proxy objects in
Flibcpp can either be in an unassigned, deallocated state or in an
allocated and internally consistent state.

Each derived type, such as the :ref:`modules_string_type`, is constructed using
a *module procedure interface* with the same name as the type. This procedure,
defined in the same module as the derived type, is a ``function`` that returns
a "constructed" type::

   use flc_string, only : String
   type(String) :: s

   s = String()

Most classes have more than one constructor (i.e. procedure interface) that
gives the object a more substantial initial state. For example, numeric vectors
can be constructed directly from a Fortran array::

  use flc_vector, only : Vector => VectorInt4
  type(Vector) :: v, v2
  v = Vector([1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13])

Assignment
----------

SWIG-Fortran, and consequently Flibcpp, defines assignment operators for its
types that control memory ownership. Assignment for these types can be grouped
into two categories: assignment directly from a Flibcpp function return value,
and assignment from an existing Flibcpp derived type value.

Flibcpp (or any other SWIG-Fortran) wrapper code sets the correct ownership
flag on a return value: non-owning for raw pointers and references; owning for
return-by-value. When the left-hand side of an assignment is uninitialized, it
captures the returned value and obtains the correct ownership flag. If the
left-hand side *is* initialized, it is automatically destroyed first.

Assignment from within Fortran is like pointer assignment. The left-hand side
becomes a non-owning reference to the right-hand side.

Destruction
-----------

Unlike native allocatable Fortran types, Flibcpp derived types are not
automatically deallocated when ending a procedure. Therefore to avoid
leaking memory, these derived type values must be explicitly cleaned up and

released. This is done by the type-bound subroutine named ``release``::

   type(Vector), intent(inout) :: v
   call v%release()

If the value ``v`` above owns the associated memory (i.e. if it was constructed
in user code), then Flibcpp cleans up and deallocates the C++ instance, and
sets ``v`` to an uninitialized state. If ``v`` merely points to existing C++
data, i.e. if it was assigned to the return result of a C++ accessor, then
Flibcpp will simply set ``v`` to an uninitialized state.
